# Can-we-program-in-CSS-
## Repository focused on studies at CSS level 5.

This repository aims to break one of the walls on what we can do with CSS. I could have written it in Brazilian Portuguese, but my goal is to really share this experience with the entire web community, not just limited to my country.

### Programming in CSS silly or is it really possible?

Before we get into the subject, let's understand how programming works. Programming is a process where we order a computer to do such a thing that in any case simulations of organic activities that we humans do.

##### An activity simulation

Certainly if you are reading this text it is because you must have a basic knowledge of programming or maybe the title was nice. About the programming process: When programming we have to give certain instructions for the activity to be done, suppose we create a marathon algorithm, this would be a basic example:

The example above is a basic thing that we keep in mind when we enter the world of programming, but now let's take a look at the style sheets. The core objective of style sheets is really what you have been learning or will learn, which in this case would be the stylization of objects created in HTML, ranging from texts, media objects and containers used in the formatting of web pages. If you don't know much about it, the CSS was created to take a weight off the HTML that before, right at the beginning of the web, it made the process take you to information and still had to style this information on its own, making it very polluted code. With the arrival of CSS we had a division of responsibilities and it was no longer necessary to make dirty and somewhat heavy HTML for reading.

### Evolution of CSS

Since its first version that was created in 1994, CSS has undergone strong changes and proving that in many things we no longer need our friend JavaScript so much that we used to do animations a lot before. Even today, we need JavaScript to validate our inputs in forms and other little things that are often necessary due to the user's browser being an old version. Today with our style sheets we can do a good part of events that before was only possible in a language as large as JavaScript, we can do everything from animations, click events, screen validation and other cool things. In order not to get a big sheet to read the continuation you will see in the file called: programming_css_part_two.
